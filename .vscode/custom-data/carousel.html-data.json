Drag interactions are not affected because speed is then determined by the drag force. Only values between 1-20 are recommended. Defaults to `10`\n\n**Note:** The speed option is actually controlling the magnitude of the attraction force to the target (where the carousel is headed). This is because Embla uses a simple physics simulation when scrolling instead of transitions."
